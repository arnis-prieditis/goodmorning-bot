# Good-morning-bot
- sends 'good morning' messages every day at the use specified time
## TODO 
- the messages (or parts of them) could be randomized
- should create a new bot and store its token locally in a file separate from the bot script
- maybe some goodbye message when the bot is shutdown (so that the user knows to reset the time)
- make so that the bot adapts to the user's local time zone
