# Good-morning-bot
- sends 'good morning' messages every day at the user specified time
- the token for the bot must be stored in a file "token.txt" in plain text in the same directory as the script
- saves running jobs in a csv file "running_jobs.csv" and restarts them after downtime
## TODO 
- the messages (or parts of them) could be randomized
- make so that the bot adapts to the user's local time zone
