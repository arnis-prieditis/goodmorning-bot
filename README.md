# Good-morning-bot
- sends 'good morning' messages every day at the use specified time
- the token for the bot must be stored in a file "token.txt" in plain text in the same directory as the script
## TODO 
- the messages (or parts of them) could be randomized
- maybe some goodbye message when the bot is shutdown (so that the user knows to reset the time)
- ^ or alternatively store all running daily jobs in a cvs/json file and start running them again on startup
- make so that the bot adapts to the user's local time zone
