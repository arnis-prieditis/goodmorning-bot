Uzticies savām spējām.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.
Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life.
The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.
You have the power to create your own success story.
Tevī ir izturība pārvarēt jebkuru izaicinājumu 💪
Exquisite 🤌
